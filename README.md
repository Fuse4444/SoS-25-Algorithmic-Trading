# SoS-25-Algorithmic-Trading

This repository documents my journey through quantitative finance and algorithmic trading as part of the Summer of Science (SoS'25) program. Most of the focus is on developing a solid foundation in financial data analysis, implementing rule-based trading strategies, and backtesting them using Python.

## Overview

- **Duration:** Mayâ€“July 2025  
- **Midterm Submission (June):** Prerequisites, foundational modules, initial code  
- **Endterm Submission (July):** Strategy development, backtesting, final reports

## Project Structure

### 1. Prerequisites (`/prerequisites`)
Core concepts in:
- Mathematics & statistics (probability, regression, hypothesis testing)
- Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Finance basics (market instruments, order types, EMH, portfolio theory)

### 2. Data & EDA (`/data_handling`)
- OHLCV data loading and preprocessing (OpenBB, Quandl)
- Resampling, normalization, and handling missing data
- Visualizing trends and patterns

### 3. Technical Indicators (`/indicators`)
- Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Ichimoku, etc.
- Code and visualizations for each indicator

### 4. Strategy Development (`/strategies`)
- Rule-based strategies:
  - Simple Moving Average Crossover (SMAC)
  - Bollinger Band Mean Reversion
  - Breakout momentum
  - Pairs trading
- Buy/sell signal plotting

### 5. Backtesting & Evaluation (`/backtesting`)
- Backtesting framework
- Performance metrics: returns, Sharpe ratio, drawdowns
